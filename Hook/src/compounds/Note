1)Why hook required?
    - HOC and Render props makes code compilcated
    -To avoid this keyword
    -Reusebility of code 
    -Reduce use of class

2)useState
    -same as state in class
    -const [name,setName] = useState("sumit);

3)useEffect
    -replacement of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentDidUnmount
    -runs after every Render

4)useContext
    -concept is same as context in class 
    -difference is in consumer side only    
5)useReducer
    -concept is used from reduce() method of js
    -state management
6)useCallback
    -Use for better performance
    -Avoid render of unneccesary function
7)useMemo
    -Avoid render of unneccesary function
    -Use for better performance
    -used when function return value
8)useRef
    -use to focus input or get text/html
    -pass as variable 
9)Costum hook   
    -used to own hook
